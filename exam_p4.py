*** Answer ***
The most interesting thing that I have learned in this class is how to anlyze and scrape data with python. For example on my assignment 2 project I used Reddit's API in what I thought was a really cool and practical way. I was able to look at Daily Discussion threads under the Bitcoin subreddit and analyze the overall sentiment in those discussions as Bitcoin's price went through the ceiling and then crashed. This was the first time I had actually used python to anlyze data in a way that allowed me to see the power of what can be accomplished with python in a short days work. Something like this Bitcoin analysis could easily be further developed into a more intense formula that pulls data from other sources and analyzes more than just the sentiment. With such a formula, the business opportunites are endless. From selling the formula as a research tool to making personal investments with a slight advantage, anything could be accomplished.

After analyzing this data, another cool thing that I was able to do was to build graphs with the data. This was another thing that I had never done with python and usually had relied on Javascript to achieve. Overall, this class has definitely made me more interested in improving my python skills and exploring what it can be used for further.
